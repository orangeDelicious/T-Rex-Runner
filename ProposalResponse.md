# Group 21 - TRex Game

## Tentative Rating
Average for game that works. Above average for complete product that looks beautiful :-)

## Comments
 - Consider how you get constant horizontal movement of the t-rex
 - How will you implement the obstacles getting harder + keep some randomization? 
 - How will you implement the collision? 
 - Consider what assets you'll use to make it look good.
